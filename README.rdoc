== DESCRIPTION:

Codeclimate integration for the flog ruby complexity analyzer.

To use, add a flog section to your .codeclimate.yml engines hash:

    engines:
      flog:
        enabled: true

If you'd like the engine to only report issues for the most complex methods in
your repo, you can set a threshold. For example:

    engines:
      flog:
        enabled: true
        config:
          all: false
          threshold: 0.6

When configured like this, the engine will only emit issues for your most
complex issues. Be aware that as you improve your most complex issues, new
issues will show up for less complex issues.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* flog ~> 4.4

== INSTALL:
